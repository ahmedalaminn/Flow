# Flow: An iOS Productivity App

## Overview
Flow is an iOS app designed to help users take control of their productivity and unlock their full potential. In a world overflowing with opportunities, information, and tools, many people work inefficiently or simply struggle to get started. 

> This gap between intention and follow-through is often where potential gets lost.

Flow aims to close that gap to work smarter. It brings proven productivity methods — like the Pomodoro Technique and Deep Work — into a lightweight, intuitive app designed for real life.

Work smarter. Work efficiently. Build consistency.
